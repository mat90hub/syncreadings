  <h2>General presentation.</h2>

  <p>The objective of this application is to reorganize sets of measures readings made
  at fixed time intervalle into a table of synchronized measures, which means a
  table with a single time column applicable to all readings on each line.</p>

  <img alt="sets into a table" class="align-center" src="./lib/html/settable.png" style="width: 762px;" />
  
  <p>The instruments are storing readings at fixed intervalle, but all instruments may
  not be using the same intervalle. The issue will be then on the way to gather
  those readings, so they can correspond to the same time. The default solution is
  to select only the measure, which are made at matching time.</p>


  <h2>User instructions.</h2>

  <p>The application screen is made of a menu, an internal frame and a status line
  placed at the bottom. The status line will give continuous information on our
  status in the application.</p>

  <p>The first user action should be to load a sets of data with the commande
  <cite>Load File</cite> from the menu <cite>Input File</cite>. The sets of data is shown in the
  frame in the background. The next actions are with the menu <cite>Data Table</cite>,
  either to obtain information on the sets <cite>Sets Analysis</cite> or to transfer the
  set into a table of synchronized measures with <cite>Format into table</cite>. When
  the sets are moved into a table, it is shown in the frame in the background,
  replacing the former sets.</p>
  
  <p>Then the user can choose to export the table either in a <strong>csv</strong> table or
  a <strong>xlsx</strong>. Otherwise, the user can also close the file with this commande
  under the menu <cite>Input File</cite> or exit the application.</p>
